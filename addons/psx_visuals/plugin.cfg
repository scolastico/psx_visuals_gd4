name="PS1 Visuals"
description="This plugin contains a few shaders and scripts that will make geometry look like it comes straight from the PlayStation 1! All of these following PSX quirks have been faithfully implemented, and can be modified (via shader globals) to suit your needs:

- Vertex lighting
- Vertex snapping (jittering)
- Affine texture warping
- Gouraud shading
- Bit depth reduction
- Dithering
- Additive emission vertex fog (a la Silent Hill)
- Raycasted shadow sprites
- Lack of mipmaps
- Filter nearest by default

To install, simply follow these steps:

1. Install into \"addons/psx\"
2. Enable the plugin in Project Settings
3. Restart Editor
4. Create ShaderMaterials using the shaders listed below, and apply to your scenes as needed!

The default shader global values are most accurate to the original hardware. There are currently two different shaders to choose from:

- psx_opaque: Suitable for solid meshes OR cutout sprite billboards. This shader handles its opacity via scissor method.
- psx_transparent: Suitable for partially transparent meshes. This shader handles its opacity normally and uses depth_draw_always.

Each shader has a double-sided version.

Note: bit depth reduction and dithering are both canvas post process effects and will apply to the entire 3D world, not just surfaces with PSX shader(s), and they will not be visible in the editor. To disable these effects, disable the plugin or modify psx_postprocess.gdshader to suit your needs."
